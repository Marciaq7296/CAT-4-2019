            <h2> Unfortunately the effects of CO2 have become worse over the years <br> </h2>
            <p> The rate of co2 levels increased by 100 to 200 times more faster over the last 10 years <br>
                Global co2 concentration stand currently at 406.4spm 
                With the rise of co2 concentration in the atmosphere it contributes to global warming and greenhouse gas emissions. <br>
                Earth's temperature increases by 1 degree fahrenheit each year.<br>
                It causes plants to provide the earth less evaporative cooling <br>
                With polar ice caps melting because of the rise of c02 levels, many land animals have died such as the famous polar bear. <br>
                High water levels are expected in the near future due to high c02 levels <br>
                Greenlands ice caps are now melting four times faster than in the year 2003 <br>
